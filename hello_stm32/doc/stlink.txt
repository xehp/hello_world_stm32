st-link can be used to copy code to target via CLI (in long run much faster than mouse clicking).
  sudo apt install libusb-1.0 cmake
  cd ~/git/
  git clone https://github.com/texane/stlink.git
  cd stlink
  Read doc/compiling.md and compile it.

Download code to device (something like this, depending on installation of st-link):
sudo /home/henrik/git/stlink/build/st-flash --format ihex write binary.hex
sudo /home/henrik/git/stlink/build/Release/st-flash --format ihex write binary.hex
sudo /home/henrik/git/stlink/build/Debug/bin/st-flash --format ihex write binary.hex




So far only tested with Nucleo which has builtin ST-Link. 

According to RM0038 Rev 16 chapter 2.7 Boot configuration

Embedded boot loader
The embedded boot loader is used to reprogram the Flash memory through one of the
following interfaces:
In Cat.1 and Cat.2 devices: USART1 or USART2.
In Cat.3, Cat.4, Cat.5 and Cat.6 devices: USART1, USART2 or USB
This program is located in the system memory and is programmed by ST during production.

So only serial port connection with an STM32 should be needed to put a new program on it.
